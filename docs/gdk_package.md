### GDK Package

To install the GDK is necessary to have the wheel locally, as it's not available for installation trough PyPi. 
So, you can find the exact version we are using for development at the moment in the [bin folder](../bin/). For recent versions or other OS please visit the official [repository](https://github.com/Blockstream/gdk/releases).

For the actual command for installation run `pip install <route/to//the/whell>`. For example, if you're at the root of the repository and are using the wheel file at the bin folder then you'll just execute `pip install ./bin/greenaddress-0.0.55-cp39-cp39-linux_x86_64.whl`.

Additional information about the library can be found in the [documentation](https://gdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gdk/)
